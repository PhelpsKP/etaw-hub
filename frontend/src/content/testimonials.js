    quote: "I have been training with Katie for 2 years now and she has helped me achieve goals I never thought imaginable. She pushed me to lose 8% body fat and improve my boxing technique, which brought me to the USIBA Collegiate National Boxing Championship last year. The best thing about Katie's training style is her burning passion for what she does. She is different from any other trainer because she lives and breathes this sport. Her energy and passion is contagious it drives you to train smarter and harder, pushing you beyond your limits to exceed your goals.",

    quote: "Katie is a great trainer! After years and years of trying other personal trainers, apps, and so on, I struggled to find a program I could stick to. I've been training with Katie for 2 yrs now, and am happy to say that she makes training fun and worth sticking with! I travel a lot and have a really unsteady work schedule, but she helps provide the tools and individualized support that helps me progress in my health goals.",

    quote: "I have been training with Katie at Elite Training for over a year and a half. It has become such an important part of my workout routine. I average about 2-3 sessions a week. I have tried many different training programs and workouts over the course my 40 years. The personal training program offered by Katie at Elite Training Cinci has yielded wonderful physical and mental results for me. They are unmatched. The workouts are full body, challenging, and worth every minute. You leave feeling accomplished and strong. Katie meets her clients where they're at on a fitness level and develops a plan tailored to one's individual goals. This, in turn, helps her clients reach their full potential. I can't thank Katie enough!!",

    quote: "I've been training with Katie for two years and she is the absolute best. She mixes up each workout so there's no boredom like you might get with other trainers or classes and they're always a great stress reliever. Katie is great at adjusting to previous injuries and limitations while also pushing you to new heights. I have a better understanding of my body's capabilities and nutritional needs since working with her. If you enjoy tough workouts with someone who will continually push you and show a genuine interest in you as more than just a client, Elite Training Cinci is worth it.",

    quote: "I have been a competitive runner for 17 years, and I work with Katie at Elite Training and Wellness weekly to build strength, learn new exercises, and box. Although my class is a group setting, Katie is always tailoring the workouts to each person - showing me what I can do to make exercises more challenging, working around my running injuries, etc.. Katie is awesome, so knowledgeable, has a great attitude, and her gym is well equipped. I would absolutely recommend going here whether you are a beginner or an elite athlete!",
