Participant Name: __________________________
Date of Birth: __________________________
I voluntarily choose to participate in fitness training, exercise programs, classes, instruction, and related activities (collectively, the “Activities”) provided by Katie Harrington, Elite Training & Wellness, TKO Performance & Fitness Center, its owners, employees, independent contractors, trainers, agents, and representatives (collectively, the “Released Parties”).

1. Assumption of Risk
I understand that participation in physical fitness activities involves inherent and unavoidable risks, including but not limited to:
Muscle strains, sprains, tears, soreness, cramps
Slips, trips, falls, and collisions
Use or misuse of exercise equipment
Equipment failure or improper setup
Physical or mental exertion
Actions or omissions of other participants
Instruction, supervision, or lack thereof
Pre-existing medical conditions, known or unknown
I knowingly, voluntarily, and expressly assume all risks, whether known or unknown, foreseeable or unforeseeable, associated with my participation in the Activities. 

2. Medical Acknowledgment
I represent that I am physically capable of participating in the Activities and that I have no medical condition that would prevent safe participation. I acknowledge that I am responsible for consulting a physician if I have any medical concerns.
I understand I am not obligated to perform nor participate in the Activities that I do not wish to do, and it is my right to refuse participation at any time during my training sessions. I understand that should I feel lightheaded, faint, dizzy, nauseous, or unusual pain, I am to stop the activity and inform the Released Parties.
I understand that no medical screening is provided, and participation is at my own risk.

3. Release and Waiver of Liability (Ordinary Negligence)
To the fullest extent permitted by Ohio law, I release, waive, and discharge the Released Parties from any and all claims, demands, damages, causes of action, or liability arising out of or related to my participation in the Activities, including claims arising from the ordinary negligence of the Released Parties.
This release does not apply to gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct, as prohibited by Ohio law.

4. Covenant Not to Sue
I agree that I will not initiate or maintain any lawsuit or legal claim against any of the Released Parties for any injury, loss, or damage arising from my participation in the Activities.

5. Indemnification
I agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Released Parties from any claims, actions, damages, costs, or attorney’s fees brought by me or by any third party arising out of or related to my participation in the Activities.

6. Emergency Medical Consent
In the event of an emergency, I authorize the Released Parties to obtain medical treatment for me. I understand that I am solely responsible for all medical costs incurred.

7. Photography and Media Release
I grant permission for photographs or video recordings of me to be used for lawful purposes, including advertising, marketing, and web content, without compensation. I release the Released Parties from any claims related to such use.

8. No Guarantee of Results / Nutrition Disclaimer
I understand that fitness results are not guaranteed. I acknowledge that Katie Harrington is not a licensed dietician and that any nutritional guidance provided is general in nature.

9. Confidential Information
I understand that fitness and intake information collected is used solely for program design and safety. I release the Released Parties from liability for any inadvertent disclosure, except where prohibited by law.

10. Governing Law and Venue
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Ohio. Any legal action shall be brought exclusively in Hamilton County, Ohio.

11. Severability
If any portion of this Agreement is held invalid, the remaining portions shall continue in full force and effect.

12. Binding Effect
This Agreement is binding upon me and my heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns.

13. Cancellation Policy
I agree to cancel online or communicate via text or phone, at least 24 hours in advance, if I need to cancel a session for any reason. If I fail to do so, I understand that I will forfeit one session if I have purchased a package. If I commit to attending a small group class and do not cancel at least 24 hours in advance, I agree to pay for the cost of the class. Cost of a pre-paid single session will also be forfeited, in the event that I cancel a session without notice 24 hours prior. If I arrive late to a session, I understand my session will end at the regularly scheduled time and I forfeit the lost time with no refund. Furthermore, I understand that sessions listed under “packages” (as shown on the Elite Training and Wellness price list) are valid for 90 days from their purchase date and sessions listed under “monthly” (as shown on the Elite Training and Wellness price list) are valid for 5 weeks from purchase date. After that time, any remaining sessions will expire and will not be able to be redeemed.


I HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY AND UNDERSTAND THAT I AM WAIVING LEGAL RIGHTS.
